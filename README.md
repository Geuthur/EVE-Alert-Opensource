# Eve Online Alert

EVE Alert - Check every 1-3 seconds if the Local has an Enemy or Neutral in System and play a sound if someone is there!

## Features

- Play Sound on Local Detection
- Easy-Use Interface
- Start/Stop System
- Monitoring Region on Picture Mode in real-time (also possible to stream via Discord for friends)
- Color Detection Mode - If Picture Mode not working for you simply use the Color Detection Mode (needs more ressources)
- Faction Spawn Detection - Now you can set a Faction Spawn Detection and it will play a sound if a faction is in Site

## Usage

- Simply launch Alert.exe, and a menu will appear. You can configure all your settings there. Afterward, click on "Start."
- If the Alert doesn't respond to the local chat, you can reduce the detection accuracy or double-check if you've set the region correctly.
- If both settings are 100% accurate and your interface is not blurred, make sure that your neutral symbol looks like this:
- You can edit all images & sounds by yourself only the name must be the same
